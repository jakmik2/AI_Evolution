Framework and AI build for Evolution Simulator

The goal is to build a simple evolution simulator, wherein agents/organisms will be free to roam, feast, and fornicate. 

The build relies on parsing an organisms "genome" (a string of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs,) into features of varying intensity, all at the expense of resource demand; being larger and faster cost extra!
